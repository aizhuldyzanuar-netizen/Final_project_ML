The contents of the file /instax-ml-project/data/instax_sales_transaction_data.csv will be a placeholder since I cannot generate actual dataset content. Here is a representation of what the CSV file might look like, including headers and some example rows:

transaction_id,transaction_date,customer_id,product_id,quantity,total_revenue,total_profit
1,2023-01-01,101,201,2,200.00,50.00
2,2023-01-02,102,202,1,100.00,20.00
3,2023-01-03,103,203,3,300.00,75.00
4,2023-01-04,104,204,1,150.00,30.00
5,2023-01-05,105,205,4,400.00,100.00

This is a sample structure and should be replaced with the actual dataset content.
